Collections Framework
----------------------

Collection - one of the root interfaces in our collection framework
			 extended by Set,List,Queue
Collections- Utility class that provides useful methods that work with Collections

How collections are unique and specifically unique from arrays:

-They cannot hold primitive data types (Use wrapper classes instead to hold those values when needed)
-Dynamic in size (Don't need to be instantiated with a size like arrays, you can but don't need to)
	-size can dynamically chage as you add/remove items
